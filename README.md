# Information-Retrieval
# Fetch the data from https://www.trec-cds.org/2021.html
# The jupyter file will fetch all the top similarities of documents and queries.
# We have combined multiple zip files to a single zip so it be convenient to run at once.
#We have imported the necessary modules and download all the zip files from the website, given the power and run all the cells till the import of the Tkinter module.

1) This Tkinter module is a GUI Interface which will give you the cosine, jaccard and dice similarities between the queries and the documents. Here we have implemented a clear button to clear the output, and we have also created a random sample query so that a user can copy the query and paste it in the input query.
2) We have also asked to use it to enter the relevant and not relevant documents, so that they can modify the query according to their needs, and this will give the result of the increased similarities of the words.Basically, the output is the is the words which we can add inquiry to get more good similarity between the documents and not relevant documents

#At the end, we have evaluated our module by using the Medline Corpus data set from the University of Glasgow and we have got the precision of 0.6 and a recall of 0.25.
